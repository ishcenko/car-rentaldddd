      <Text>
        Kryvyi Rih is a large administrative center of Ukraine, which is part of
        the Dnipropetrovsk region. The city of metallurgists, heavy industry,
        lush greenery and "Martian" red quarry dust. It occupies a huge area,
        the distance between the two most distant microdistricts of the city
        (Terny and Ingulets) is more than 120 kilometers, it is rightfully
        considered one of the longest settlements in Europe. In its conditions,
        the topic of car rental is very relevant for residents and guests of the
        city. Not everyone who lives in Kryvyi Rih or periodically comes here
        for work or personal business finds it beneficial to have a personal car
        and use their own vehicle for business purposes. City roads still leave
        much to be desired. Plus, it's not a secret for anyone that owning a car
        involves the constant bearing of considerable costs related to scheduled

        think about exorbitant costs directly related to the content of the car.
